# Freenove Hexapod Mods
This repository contains various python programs and Arduino sketches for use with the FreenoveHexapodv2 kit as a base. (ArduinoMega + Arduino Uno)
These should be pretty easily modified to use with the base components, an Ardunio Mega and/or an Arduino Uno. If you have any suggestions or comments feel free to message BuzzardFoods on github.
